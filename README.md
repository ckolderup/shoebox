# The Shoebox

A collection of small .rb files for use with [Shoes][shoesrb].
The repository was started for the [Two Shoes Weekend][tsw], but hopefully there will be more to come.

## Big Fan (bigfan.rb)

Big Fan displays the most recent tweets that were favorited by @ckolderup on Twitter one at a time.
You can navigate between the tweets using the up/down arrow keys, page up, page down, home and end.

## Dots (dots.rb)

Dots creates a sandbox for dots to bounce around. Press 'a' to add a new dot. As you add new dots, the older ones will phase out. But that's okay! Such is life.

Dots comes with lib/dot.rb, which is some code that could theoretically be used to do more stuff in the future. I might write some actual games or something!
